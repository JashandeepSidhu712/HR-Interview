# HOw do you handle challenging solutions?

When faced with challenging situations, I approach them methodically by breaking down the problem, researching potential solutions, analyse problem from different angles and seeking advice when necessary. 
This helps me stay focused and find effective resolutions

In challenging situations, I remain composed, analyze the situation from different angles, and prioritize steps to address the issue. I'm open to collaboration and feedback, which allows me to learn and improve in the process
