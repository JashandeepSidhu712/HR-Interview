### Tell me about youself.

Good morning mam/sir. I hope you are having a wonderful day. <br>
I am **Jashandeep Kaur Sidhu**, a final year student **with a strong passion** for software engineering. My journey in the world of technology began during my early academic years and has grown into a profound interest that fuels my academic pursuits today. <br>
As I approach the completion of my degree in **Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering** from **Giani Zail Singh Campus College of Engineering and Technology, Bathinda**, I am excited about the opportunity to transition from an enthusiastic learner to a professional software engineer. <br>
I successfully concluded my **10th-grade education at St. Joseph Convent School, Bathinda**, achieving an **impressive 93.4 percent**. Similarly, for my 12th-grade studies, I graduated from Sacred Heart Convent Senior Secondary School, Bathinda, **attaining a notable 88.6 percent**. <br>

What draws me to software engineering is the dynamic nature of the field and its potential to shape the future. The ever-evolving landscape of technology presents challenges that intrigue me and opportunities that inspire me to contribute meaningfully. 

During my studies, as part of Development, I have worked on mainly 4 projects namely **HostelConnect, Nodues, and easeNodus**, which are database connected dynamic websites and NewspaperFlow, which is Desktop Application based on Java Programming. These projects experience have reinforced my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and tackle real-world problems through code and digitalise the manual work. <br>
**Along with it, i immersed myself** in Database Management Systems, Object Oriented Programming, Computer Networks, Software Engineering along with others.

**In addition**, I bring a strong aptitude for problem-solving and critical thinking. I excel at **breaking down intricate problems**, analyzing their components, and devising effective solutions. My **attention to detail ensures accuracy** in my code and designs.

Maintaing consistency in improving my problem solving skills, i solved 250+ Data Structure problems on Geeksforgeeks platform, 150+ problems on Leetcode, along wth giving numbers of contests on CodeChef with 200+ problems on the same.

I enjoy working in collaborative units, which allow me to learn from others and keeps me motivated to bring better results on table.

Also being the President Of Student Literary Club in my campus, i have strong time management skills which help me meet deadlines while juggling multiple tasks, with good communications skills as my core strength. Being in the position also helped me improve my public speaking skills, with which i have been addressing students in Induction Programs, Youth fest as well while giving guidance to the juniors in the campus. Events that were organised in the club were Group discussions, Debates, Aptitude test, which are specially designed to help students prepare for their interviews and placements.

Along with this, i am also the Co-Founder of CodeWave Community, which is a dynamic platform fostering a collaborative coding culture in the campus. This community was brought to life in July this year, from then on, we have been providing constant doubt support to the students, motivating them to participate in coding contests, nurturing a community of like-minded individuals, facilitating knowledge sharing and a focused learning environment.

Joining [Company Name] aligns perfectly with my aspirations to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to learn under the guidance of industry experts while actively participating in projects that push the boundaries of innovation. As a final year student eager to embark on a professional journey, I am dedicated to embracing the challenges and opportunities, developing my skills further and a chance to contribute to the company's ongoing success.
