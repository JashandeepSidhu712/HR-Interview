# DESCRIBE A PROJECT WHERE YOU FACED TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. HOW DID YOU APPROACH AND OVERCOME THEM?

Undertaking new projects and translating innovative concepts into code is a challenges in itself. 

I encountered two significant hurdles during my involvement in the HostelConnect project. 

One involved the implementation of a button to facilitate the export of tabular data to an Excel sheet. 
This table was dynamically populated from a database using the ng-repeat directive. 

The second challenge centered around effectively binding an input field to a variable, ensuring seamless data storage in the database, and maintaining proper input field clearing.

Navigating these complexities demanded an exhaustive exploration of various approaches. For the Excel export functionality, I meticulously researched solutions and experimented with different methods. Through leveraging techniques like ng-model, slice manipulation, indexing, and strategic array operations, I ultimately triumphed in establishing a seamless data binding mechanism.

This experience underscored the importance of persistence and a methodical approach to problem-solving, leading to successful outcomes even when tackling intricate technical difficulties.
