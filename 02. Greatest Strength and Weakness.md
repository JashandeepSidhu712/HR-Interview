# STRENGTH

One of my greatest strengths is my unwavering determination. 

When faced with challenges or obstacles, I have a strong tendency never to give up. Instead, I keep trying and pushing myself until I find a solution. 

This characteristic became particularly evident during one of my recent projects when I encountered a significant challenge. It took me relentless effort over the course of two days to navigate through the issue and finally arrive at a solution. 

This experience reinforced my belief that with persistence and the right mindset, even the most complex problems can be overcome. It's this determination that has allowed me to continuously learn and grow in my journey as a software engineer, and I consider it a vital asset in my professional development.

# WEAKNESS

One weakness I've identified in myself is occasional **demotivation**, especially when **tackling complex data structure problems**. 

Data structure problems can be challenging, and there have been moments when I felt frustrated, even to the point of questioning my passion for software engineering. 

However, I've learned to address this weakness by staying calm and reminding myself of why I started this journey in the first place. I view these challenges as opportunities for growth and improvement, and I use them to fuel my passion. 

This approach has not only helped me persevere through difficult problems but has also reinforced my determination to excel in the field. I've come to understand that occasional demotivation is a common experience in any profession, and it's how we deal with it and push through that truly matters.
