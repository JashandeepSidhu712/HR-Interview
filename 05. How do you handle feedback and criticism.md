# HOW DO U HANDLE FEEDBACK AND CRITICISM?

I approach feedback and criticism with an open mind, viewing them as valuable insights. I use constructive feedback to refine my skills and make positive changes in my work.

Feedback and criticism and making neccessary improvements to enhance performance are essential. I focus on specific areas that require development and take initiative to fix them, making sure i dont take them personally.
