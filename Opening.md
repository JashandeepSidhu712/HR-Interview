Hello mam/sir. I am Jashandeep Kaur Sidhu, a final year student with a strong passion for software engineering. <br>
As I approach the completion of my degree in Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, I am excited about the opportunity to transition from an enthusiastic learner to a professional software engineer. <br>
What draws me to software engineering is the dynamic nature of the field and its potential to shape the future.

During my studies, I have worked on projects such as HostelConnect, and Nodues both associated with my institution Giani Zail Singh College Campus of Engineering and Technology, Bathinda, along with easeNodus and Newspaper flow. These projects experience reinforced my ability to work in a team and apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges and tackling real-world problems through code and digitalising manual work. <br>
Along with it, i immersed myself in Database Management, Object Oriented Programming, Computer Networks, Software Engineering and more courses.

In addition, I bring a strong aptitude for problem-solving and critical thinking. I excel at breaking down intricate problems, analyzing their components, and devising effective solutions. My attention to detail ensures accuracy in my code and designs.

Maintaing consistency in improving my problem solving skills, i solved 250+ Data Structures and Algorithms on Geeksforgeeks platform, and solving 150+ questions on Leetcode, along wth giving numbers of contests on CodeChef.

I enjoy working in collaborative units, which allows me to learn from others and keeps me motivated to think better and obtain greater results.

As i am the President Of Student Literary Club in my campus, i have strong time management skills which enabled me to meet deadlines while juggling multiple tasks, with good communications skills as my core strength.
