# HOW DO YOU HANDLE CHALLENGES OR CONFLICTS WITHIN A TEAM ENVIRONMENT?

I believe in open communication and collaboration. 
If conflicts arise, I would proactively address the issue with my team members, listen to their perspectives, and work towards finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

Clear communication, empathy, and a focus on the project's goals are essential in resolving conflicts effectively.
